                <A0>The purpose was to offer quantities of videos to enable the development of motion correction algorithms for subsequent data acquisition. The algorithm/program should be able to accurately adjust which pixels are sampled within each frame to keep a Region-of-Interest within the target area and, thus, produce a more sensitive and accurate quantification.   </A0>

The answers to some of these questions reveal information about compliance with the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.</description>
            <questions>
                <Q0>What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., samples, images, people)?</Q0>
                <Q1>How many instances are there in total?</Q1>
                <Q2>Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?</Q2>
                <Q3>What data does each instance consist of?</Q3>

                <Q7>Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?</Q7>
                <Q8>Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?</Q8>
                <Q9>Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, public databases, other datasets and/or private silos)?</Q9>
                <Q10>Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals&#8217; non-public communications)?</Q10>

                <Q12>Does the dataset not relate to people (e.g., animals, cell lines, environment)?</Q12>
                <Q13>Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender, etc.)?</Q13>
                <Q14>Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?</Q14>
                <Q15>Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?</Q15>
