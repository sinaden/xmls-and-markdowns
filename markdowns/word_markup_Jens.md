**For what purpose was the dataset created?**  
  
Based on one of the world’s largest patient cohorts with metagenomic sequenced fecal samples we wanted to describe the interplay between previous treatment with antibiotics and presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In order to do this, we have established a bioinformatic pipeline to map antibiotic resistance genes and we have established an automatic way of extracting data on use of antibiotics (anti-bacteria, -virus, -fungi), immunosuppressants and chemotherapy. Moreover, we have detailed data on demographics, clinical outcomes and other microbiome features such as taxonomy.  
  
**Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?**  
  
This dataset was created by Persimune Health Informatics (PHI) in collaboration with Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
